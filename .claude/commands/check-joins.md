Review join configurations across the codebase:

1. **Search for join definitions** in all platform files
2. **List all join types used**:
   - Digital joins (d)
   - Analog joins (a)
   - Serial joins (s)
3. **Check for consistency** in join usage patterns
4. **Verify documentation** matches implementation
5. **Identify any unused or undocumented joins**

Provide a summary table of joins by platform and any recommendations for improvements.
