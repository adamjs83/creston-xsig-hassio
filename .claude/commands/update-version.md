Update the version number for a new release.

Steps to perform:
1. Ask the user what version number to use (e.g., 1.2.0)
2. Update `custom_components/crestron/manifest.json` with the new version
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes for this version
4. Show a summary of what was changed
5. Ask if user wants to commit and create the tag

Do not automatically commit or push - wait for user confirmation.
